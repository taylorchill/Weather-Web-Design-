# Web-Design-Challenge
The purpose of this project was to create a website that analyze if latitude has an effect on cities temperature, humdity, cloudiness, and windspeed. Using the OpenWeatherMap API data, I gathered data for over 500 cities.

I have found several different relations of the various weather conditons vs. latitude. The following are my findings:
  1. As latitude increases, the temperature decreased once latitude hits 0.Temperature was at a steady increase from -60 to 0.
  2. Many cities had a humdity of 100, no matter where they were located latitude wise.
  3. Many of the cities experienced 0% cloudiness.It is hard to say there is a relationship betweeen latitude and cloudiness percentage.
  4. It was interesting to see that there were only a few cities with wind speed higher than 20mph.Most cities ranged between 0-15mph.
